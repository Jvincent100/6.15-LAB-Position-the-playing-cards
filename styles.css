For the <label> tag, set display to inline-block, use a width of 55px, align the text to the left, and add a margin on the right of 4px. 

ChatGPT
Sure, here's an example of how you can style the <label> tag using CSS with the specified properties:

css
Copy code
label {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 55px;
  text-align: left;
  margin-right: 4px;
}
In this example, the display property is set to inline-block to make the <label> element behave like an inline element while allowing you to set a specific width. The width property is set to 55px, aligning the text to the left with the text-align property, and a margin-right of 4px is added to create some spacing between labels if they appear side by side.

For the button, add a 1px solid gray border, 180px width, 12px padding, and 5px margin on top. 

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of how you can style a <button> element with the specified properties using CSS:

css
Copy code
button {
  border: 1px solid gray;
  width: 180px;
  padding: 12px;
  margin-top: 5px;
}
In this example, the border property is set to 1px solid gray to add a 1px solid gray border around the button. The width property is set to 180px to give the button a width of 180 pixels. The padding property is set to 12px to add 12 pixels of padding inside the button. Lastly, the margin-top property is set to 5px to create a 5-pixel margin at the top of the button.

Certainly! Here's the updated CSS code for styling the <button> element with the new specifications:

css
Copy code
button {
  border: 1px solid gray;
  width: 190px;
  padding: 15px;
  margin-top: 6px;
}
In this updated example, I've adjusted the width, padding, and margin-top properties according to your new specifications while keeping the border property to add a 1px solid gray border around the button.

In this example, I've adjusted the width, padding, and margin-top properties based on your latest specifications, while still keeping the border property to add a 1px solid gray border around the button.

Requirements
Use either an embedded stylesheet or inline styles for all formatting.
Use a <div> for each of the 4 verse containers and the outer container.
The title “Yesterday” uses an <h2> tag with a 16pt Arial font that is blue and italicized. Do not use an <i> tag.
The entire song is embedded in a container that is 600 x 280 pixels, has a two pixel solid blue border, and a five pixel padding. The background color is #F0F0F0.
The outer <div>'s first child is the <h2>. The 4 child <div>s follow, declared in the order listed below.
The yellow section:
has a background color of "yellow"
floats to the left
has a 200 pixel width
has a 10 pixel padding
has a right margin of 10 pixels, with all other margins set to 0
The section with no background color has no CSS styling.
The orange section:
has a background color of "orange"
is positioned at (110px, 200px) with absolute positioning
has a 200 pixel width
has a 10 pixel padding
The orange-red section:
has a background color of "rgb(255, 80, 0)"
has white text
floats to the right
has a 200 pixel width
has a 10 pixel padding
has a right margin of 40 pixels, a top margin of 20 pixels, and all other margins set to 0

Testing flexbox styles of <div> tag child of <div> tag child of summary class
ChatGPT
Of course! If you'd like to test the flexbox styles of the <div> tag that is a child of another <div> tag within the summary class, you can structure your HTML like this:

html
Copy code
<div class="summary">
  <div>
    <!-- This is the <div> tag child of <div> tag child of summary class -->
  </div>
</div>
Make sure to include the content you want to test within the inner <div> element. The styles you provided for the <div> tag in this context are:

css
Copy code
.summary > div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
This will make the inner <div> a flex container with the space-between justification applied to its child elements. You can place your content inside the inner <div> and observe how the justify-content: space-between; style affects the layout of its child elements.

Testing flexbox styles of ingredients and directions classes
ChatGPT
Certainly! If you want to test the flexbox styles of the ingredients and directions classes, you can structure your HTML like this:

html
Copy code
<div class="ingredients">
  <!-- Content for the ingredients section -->
</div>

<div class="directions">
  <!-- Content for the directions section -->
</div>
You can place your content within each of these <div> elements, and the styles you provided for the ingredients and directions classes will be applied:

css
Copy code
.ingredients,
.directions {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: 45%;
}
These styles will make the ingredients and directions sections flex containers, and they will share 45% of the available space each while allowing them to grow if needed.

Remember to place the respective content within each <div> element to see how the flexbox styles affect the layout of the ingredients and directions sections.

Add the following CSS to the #board selector in the embedded stylesheet:

A display property that makes the board's <div> element a grid layout container.
A grid-template-columns property to create 3 columns that are all 100px wide.
A grid-template-rows property to create 3 rows that are all 100px tall.
A grid-gap property to create a 10px gap between each of the 9 grid cells.
A justify-content property that centers the grid horizontally.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's the updated CSS for the #board selector in the embedded stylesheet, with the properties you specified:

css
Copy code
#board {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px 100px;
  grid-gap: 10px;
  justify-content: center;
}
With these styles, the #board element will become a grid layout container with 3 columns and 3 rows, each sized at 100px. There will be a 10px gap between each of the 9 grid cells, and the content of the grid cells will be centered horizontally within the container.
